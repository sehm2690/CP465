the top line reaching $244 million. EPS, at 11 cents, was far above the 8-cent net loss recorded in the year-ago quarter. Both numbers beat the Wall Street estimates by substantial margins. For the full year 2020, the net loss came in at $18.5 million, or less than one-fourth of the 2019 figure.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Since the earnings were released, RDFN shares are down 25%. Investors are somewhat spooked by the company’s Q1 guidance, for a quarterly loss in the $36 million to $39 million range. This is higher than 2020’s total loss, and there is some worry that Redfin is slipping away from profitability. The company is facing growth headwinds from two factors, a lack of agents and a lack of properties to list. The first factor can be met by a hiring drive, but the second is out of the company’s control – and only partly compensated for by higher property values.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/ygal-arounian\">Ygal Arounian</a>, 5-star analyst with Wedbush, wrote a note on Redfin titled, ‘Buy the Dip, There’s a Lot to Like Here.’ </p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>“The strength in the housing market is continuing to drive material benefits to Redfin, where it is having trouble keeping up with demand. Customers seeking service from agents was +54 y/y, even after Redfin made changes to its site that discouraged customers from requesting tours when an agent was unlikely to be available,\" Arounian wrote.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The analyst added, \"Redfin still doesn't have nearly the amount of agents it needs for the level of demand it is seeing and is hiring aggressively to get there. Agent recruiting increased by ~80% for lead agents in Dec/ Jan vs. Sep/Oct. Redfin is also seeing increasing repeat rates and referrals, which can support growth for longer.”</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>To this end, Arounian put a $109 price target on the stock, indicating his confidence in a 57% one-year upside, and backing 
his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating.

Could Overtake Bitcoin, Messari Analyst Says","link":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-could-overtake-bitcoin-messari-165845569.html","summary":"What Happened: Ryan Watkins, an analyst at cryptocurrency research firm Messari, believes Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) could surpass Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) to become the most valuable cryptocurrency. In a recent interview with Fintech Today, Watkins said that the shift towards Ethereum 2.0 would bring about some changes in the coin’s monetary policy, which could lead 
to Ether (ETH) taking over as the leading cryptocurrency in the future. Why It Matters: According to Watkins, Bitcoin’s unique selling point as a “store of value” asset is the fact that its monetary policy is very predictable. “I think that the shift to Ethereum 2.0 and proof of stake, which is kind of like a new way of securing the Ethereum blockchain....Ethereum may actually be more secure than Bitcoin”, he said. Watkins pointed out that the new monetary policy brought about by Ethereum 2.0 would lead to ETH being a deflationary asset, as more of the token’s supply is burned every year. While this would undoubtedly lead to a higher value proposition for Ethereum, the Messari analyst highlighted how the rise in DeFi (decentralized finance) applications being built on the Ethereum has further propelled the blockchain’s utility in the crypto space. “The way Ethereum becomes money is not actually by being adopted by countries as a currency; the way it becomes money is actually by building his own economy,” explained Watkins while stating that the GDP of Ethereum is actually rivaling many large countries in the world. Data from Blockchain Center shows that Ethereum has 
already surpassed Bitcoin in terms of node count, transaction count, and total transaction fees. However, in terms of market cap, Ethereum’s $200 billion is still a ways off from Bitcoin’s market cap of $1 trillion. Price Action: Bitcoin was trading at $59,063 with a slight loss of 0.67% in the past twenty-four hours. Ethereum was trading at $1,826, showing 0.15% growth in twenty-four hours and a 3.84% gain over the past week.

to rejoice following the stimulus checks, but Ethereum has use cases on its side. U.S. President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID Relief Bill has passed congress and stimulus checks are soon to be distributed. Early signs indicate recipients are ready to buy Bitcoin. A survey by Mizuho Securities showed that out of 235 participants who expect to receive stimulus checks from the COVID Relief Bill, 10% are interested in investing in Bitcoin. It's a small sample size, but according to the survey investing in Bitcoin was a more popular response than investing in traditional stocks. If that kind of runaway popularity doesn't move you in itself, consider that it could translate into $40 billion dollars running like a river directly from Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package into Bitcoin. In the same week, Bank of America strategists suggested to Bloomberg that the price of BTC can be moved 1% for just $93 million. Bank of America strategists said in a note to Bloomberg on Wednesday: \"Bitcoin is extremely sensitive to increased dollar demand. We estimate a net inflow into Bitcoin of just $93 million would result in price appreciation of 1%, while the similar figure for gold would be closer to $2 billion or 20 times higher. In contrast, the same analysis for the 20-year-plus Treasuries shows that multibillion money flows do not have a significant impact on price, pointing to the much larger and stable nature of the U.S. Treasuries markets,\" If you take the survey and projections on face value, you could surmise Bitcoin prices will be moved by over 430% by the influx of $40,000,000 flowing in from invested U.S. COVID Relief money. It seems reasonable to expect the 12 month Bitcoin bull run to continue, making it the crypto success story of 2021, right? DeFi Could Steal Bitcoin's Thunder Before the Bitcoin bull run, DeFi was a strong competitor as the most dominant story 
in crypto. BTC's new price heights have made the world's most famous cryptocurrency again the center of attention. Bitcoin may always be the star of the cryptoworld and certainly has seen wide popularity and acceptance as a store of value, but Ethereum's fortunes have generally kept pace with and possibly exceeded Bitcoin since the end of last year. Since December 2020, Bitcoin has risen from over $28,000 to more than $58,000 (up roughly 207%). Ethereum has traveled from more than $746 to over $1800 (up roughly %240). This week, Bank of America published a report titled \"Bitcoin's Dirty Little Secrets\". Excerpts from the report are unflattering to the world's most famous cryptocurrency. Some of the statements coming from the report include: \"The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer appreciation...\" \"There is no good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up...\" And they point out Bitcoin's environmental impact is not desirable, stating: \"we calculate that a $1bn dollar inflow into Bitcoin is equal to 1.2mn cars driven over the course of a year or 12.7mn barrels of oil.\" They go on to extol the virtues of Ethereum, stating in the report: \"Bitcoin is the most talked about cryptocurrency but Ethereum [the blockchain] has more features, including being more flexible in its hosting of decentralized finance (DeFi) than the Bitcoin blockchain.\" \"DeFi does, however, show the opportunity which (distributed ledger technology) offers to finance. We believe that one of the best differences against being disintermediated by DeFi would be mainstream finance grasping these opportunities.\" The Hopes and Fears of DeFi... As a digital currency, Bitcoin is simply designed with a more limited range of use cases compared to Ethereum which has smart contract capabilities. Arguably, Ethereum is the needed sequel to Bitcoin's success. But how will their performances compare in 2021? \"Bitcoin is the asset of choice for investors looking for a store of value investment characteristics in the cryptocurrency market. Success then is an ongoing price appreciation for this asset. And appreciate it will as long as investors continue to believe in the future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, on the other hand, is not only a cryptocurrency. It is a network that supports smart contracts, Dapps (decentralized applications), and Defi (decentralized finance) projects. Investors that are looking to invest in up-and-coming tech should pay extra attention to this crypto asset. Over 41 Billion dollars is currently locked in DeFi projects on Ethereum blockchain compared with 4 Billion only 8 months ago. That's what success continues to look like for Ethereum this year as well -- ongoing expansion and innovation,\" Tally Greenberg, Head of Business Development at Allnodes said. Phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0 -- known as \"Serenity\" -- launched on December 1, 2020. The hope for this upgrade to the Ethereum network is meant to address the needs for speed, efficiency, and scalability. \"BTC is unlikely to be dethroned as the leading cryptocurrency, but the growth shown on the Ethereum blockchain is hard to bet against. They will naturally be compared 'against' one another although this makes little sense from a functional point of view since each is vying for separate and mutually beneficial use-cases. BTC's 'digital gold' narrative is straightforward which is beneficial for attracting new users who may be intimidated by the apparently more complex and dynamically evolving ETH narrative,\" Jason Peckham, Analyst at Invictus Capital said. Ethereum 2.0 is moving from Proof of Stake to Proof of Work but is still essentially in test stages. It remains to be seen whether it will handle the need for speed to support the DeFi range of use cases. \"To me, Ethereum looks very attractive for long-term purchases, since it has a much greater technical potential for application than Bitcoin. The Ethereum blockchain programmability offers incredible growth opportunities. Bitcoin with its limited emission is rather a tool for saving and paying. Ethereum, in turn, is a tool for real usage of blockchain technology in third-party projects,\" Dyanis Zabauski, CEO 
of Coinmatics said. But nevermind the actual real-world uses -- can Ethereum compete with Bitcoin's price performance? \"I think it's highly likely that ETH will beat BTC in terms of price performance in 2021... Ethereum has not fully realized the benefit from the growing popularity of DeFi services and NFTs. The exploding NFT market will directly benefit the value of ETH and I think that ETH has room to grow until its price encompasses the current excitement around NFTs,\" Noam Levenson cryptocurrency writer and founder of Narrow Straight Writing. Some experts point to lagging performance as a reason to keep an eye on Ethereum, as we may see much more movement in 2021. \"From a relative performance standpoint, ETH the second-biggest cryptocurrency is lagging Bitcoin up only 20% from it's All-Time Highs vs Bitcoin 175%. In previous cycles, we have seen ETH catch up to BTC growth when BTC begins to correct because the profits taken from BTC are cycled into altcoins. Because ETH is one to two cycles back from BTC in its growth cycle it makes sense that return on the laggard would outperform the larger market cap of BTC from here,\" Jake Wujastyk Chief Market Analyst at TrendSpider said. Until Ethereum 2.0 is a known quantity, there will be doubts about its ability to meet the already tremendous need for bandwidth to support transactions. \"Ethereum might beat Bitcoin in terms of percentage gain this year. So far in 2021, ETH has increased by value by nearly 150%, while bitcoin has gone up around 90%. However, it is unlikely that ETH will take over in terms of market capitalization because bitcoin is the cryptocurrency with the most people behind it in terms of adoption and use. Many view bitcoin as digital gold and major corporations and institutional investors are adding it to their balance sheets. Ethereum is unscalable in its current iteration and acts more as a 
platform for decentralized applications than a store of value\" Ben Weiss, president and COO of CoinFlip said. The launch of an improved Ethereum network is a testament to the strength of the project -- but also represents change. Change conveys risk -- while Bitcoin is simple, immutable, and constantly rising in value. \"I am not yet convinced DeFi is as groundbreaking as its followers deem it to be. The idea of yield farming sounds a great deal like smart contract hot potato with investors jumping from project to project, hoping they aren't the last ones to hold the bag,\" Don Wyper, COO at DigitalMint said. Institutional investors have been key to driving the value of Bitcoin over the past 12 months. Will those same traditional investing giants turn their attention to Ethereum? \"Eventually some institutional investors will acquire ETH in order to expand their crypto exposure, while others will trade the recently launched CME ETH futures (interest is still low with volumes 8% of the CME BTC Futures). Others will acquire ETH in order to utilize and experiment with some of the applications, particularly in DeFi. However, I don't see much movement comparable to bitcoin in the near term,\" Jason Lau, COO at OKCoin said. Conclusion As many respondents pointed out, comparisons between Ethereum and Bitcoin make sense from an investor point of view, but the comparisons don't go much further than that. \"BTC and ETH are different: BTC is a currency token while the ETH is a utility token. If mainstream institutional investors get into ETH, it would mean that mainstream institutions validate not only the current value of ETH, but also the 
Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. We have not seen signs of mainstream institutions being involved in Ethereum's applications. So, in order for institutional investors to get on board, it would take more time and market education throughout 2021 and beyond,\" Haohan Xu, CEO of Apifiny said It may take a shift in mainstream understanding -- or even a mild learning curve -- to get traditional investors who have tried the familiar Bitcoin to understand the power of DeFi, but 
it seems the mighty bull run market is raising all ships in the cryptoworld and institutional investors are already getting on board. \"Institutional investors are already getting on board with Ethereum. Just recently, Grayscale, the world's largest Crypto asset manager, purchased more Ethereum than Bitcoin for a change. Chinese public firm Meitu also grabbed 15K of Ether not too long ago. Galaxy Digital's ETH funds raised 32 Million in less than a month. The launch of 
Ethereum Futures on the CME, the launch of Canadian ETH ETFs, and we're just scratching the surface here... I anticipate a further surge of institutional investments in Ethereum. This is just the beginning,\" Greenberg said. Cover image

For children under 6, you’ll receive $300.</p> \n<p>In total, depending on how old your kids are, you’ll receive either $3,000 or $3,600 for this year. The monthly payments will account for the first half, while the other half will 
be refundable next year when you <a href=\"https://moneywise.com/a/best-tax-software?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;utm_medium=A&amp;utm_campaign=16069&amp;utm_content=16069_file+your+taxes\">file your taxes</a> for 2021.</p> \n<p>The IRS will base your household's eligibility on the income in your most recent tax return, which will likely be the one for 2020. The IRS has extended the filing deadline from April 15 to May 17.</p> \n<p>This temporary change to the credit provides families with up to $1,600 more per child that can be used however you like: for family expenses, debt, savings or even investing. You could open investing accounts for the children; one popular app allows kids to grow their accounts <a href=\"https://moneywise.com/a/how-your-small-change-can-help-build-your-investing-portfolio?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;utm_medium=A&amp;utm_campaign=16069&amp;utm_content=16069_merely+by+adding+spare+change\">merely by adding spare change</a>.</p> \n<p>In previous years, you could claim a credit of only as much as $2,000 per child, and just $1,400 was refundable.

You can expect to receive $550 every month from July to December; if you claimed the child credit for the kids last year, they’ll be accounted for on your tax return and you should be set to receive payments.</p> \n<p>But if you welcome a baby into the family this year, can you get checks for the new addition?</p> \n<p>Tucked into the relief bill is a request for the IRS to set up a new online portal where families can update their information, including the number of qualifying children.</p> \n<p>The hope is that this portal will be up and running by July, so you'll just be able to go online and enter the information about that joyful reason for all the sleepless nights you're now having.</p> \n<p>If you don't give the IRS an update through the portal, you’ll have to wait until you file your 2021 taxes to claim the $3,600 credit for 
your family newcomer.</p> \n<h2>What about divorced parents?</h2> \n<p>Things get a little trickier with parents who are divorced. Unless this is your first year filing taxes since the separation, you already know that only one parent can claim your children as dependents on their taxes.</p> \n<p>Usually, it's the parent who has the kids for the most time over the course of the year. If you have a 50/50 custody agreement, the credit typically goes to the parent with the higher adjusted gross income. (That's taxable income before the standard deduction or itemized deductions have been subtracted.)</p> \n<p>Some divorced parents with shared custody agree to alternate on claiming the child tax credit. But given that the enhanced credit — with the monthly cash payments — is effective only for this year, there’s bound to be some conflict.</p> \n<p>The IRS will likely be sending the payments to the parent who claims the child or children on their 2020 taxes, because the agency typically defaults to the most current information it has on file.</p> \n<p>If that doesn’t reflect who should be receiving the 2020 credit for your family, you’ll want to use that new portal once it's ready, to update your information and ensure the correct parent gets the payments.</p> \n<h2>What if you need the money right now?</h2> \n<p></p>\n<figure> \n <img alt=\"young smiling parent calculating bills at home\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/db5lvnYUkinWi1WI0HlKOw--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/47036974e60448d5fec1bad31948a48e\"> \n <figcaption>\n  <cite>GreenMiles / Shutterstock</cite>\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p></p> \n<p>If you don’t qualify for the enhanced credit, or you can’t wait until July for extra relief, here are some options to find more cash right away:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Cut the cost of your debt.</strong> If you’ve been relying on credit cards throughout the pandemic, expensive interest is bound to catch up with you.

As the country now heads into its second springtime of the pandemic, JPMorgan equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas made series of observations on the options facing investors. \"We remain of the view that Cyclical stocks continue to lead on the upside as the business cycle strengthens, but also see some broadening out in market participation given the significant de-risking that has occurred within high Growth and expensive Momentum stocks... Growth stocks have also gotten substantially de-risked, de-coupled from Momentum factor, and now appear much less vulnerable (e.g. even to rising bond yields),\" Lakos-Bujas noted. In short, the strategist sees opportunity for investors now, as economic growth appears to be grinding back into gear. Turning Lakos-Bujas' outlook into concrete recommendations, JPMorgan analysts are pounding the table on two stocks that look especially compelling. According to these analysts, each name is poised to surge in the 12 months ahead. After running JPM's stock picks through TipRanks’ database, we found out that the rest of the Street is also standing squarely in the bull camp as each boasts a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus.

Precious metal streaming companies, like Wheaton, exist to smooth over these bumps (which are sometimes substantial) and bring a level of predictability to metals markets. Streamer companies enter agreements with the mining companies, to buy up some or all production at a pre-determined price. The streamer can then sell the metals at the prevailing market price. Wheaton is one of the world’s largest precious metal streaming companies, with 2020 revenues of $1.09 billion, a company record, and a market cap of $18 billion. In its financial report on 4Q20, the company showed several strong metrics. Operating cash flow hit $208 million for the quarter, and $750 million for the full year. The company, as noted, record annual revenue, and was able to reduce net debt to just $2 million. Moreover, Wheaton raised its quarterly dividend to 13 cents per common share. Solid metal production, ahead of the previously published 2020 guidance, underlay these gains. JPMorgan analyst Tyler Langton likes what he's seeing, noting: “At current metal prices, the company should generate around $1.0 billion of cash flow this year, which we think will be directed at deals and/or its dividend. While the precious metal stocks as a whole have been pressured recently by rising interest rates and falling gold prices, we still see upside in WPM’s stock price even when running a $1,600/oz. gold price through the model…” Langton puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on WMP shares, and his $58 price target suggests it has room for a 53% upside over the next 12 months. (To watch Langton’s track record, click here) The Strong Buy consensus rating on WPM shows that Wall Street believes this stock is as good as gold. The 12 recent reviews here include 9 to Buy and 3 to Hold. Shares are priced at $40.12, and the $52.45 average target implies an upside of 30%. (See WPM stock analysis on TipRanks) Smartsheet, Inc. (SMAR) Next up is Smartsheet, a SaaS company, which offers cloud-based workspace management and collaboration products. These software products, permitting faster and more efficient remote access teamwork, have an obvious compatibility with the current office-work environment. Smartsheet reported its 4Q21 – and full fiscal-year results – earlier this week, and showed some strong gains on key metrics. For the quarter, revenue was up 40% year-over-year to $109.9 million. The top line was driven by a 49% increase in billings, to $151.2 million, and by a 42% increase in subscription revenue, to $101.1 million. The company had strongly positive cash flow in the quarter, $9.9 million in net free cash flow. This was a strong turnaround from the year-ago quarter, when cash flow was negative. For the full year, the company reported a top line of $385.5 million, up 42% yoy. Again, subscription revenue was particularly pointed out; this metric rose 45% you to $352.8 million. A look at Smartsheet’s recurring revenues will help shed light on the company’s confidence. Smartsheet tracks the annualized contract value (ACV) as a measure of gross income; customers with ACV greater of $5,000 or more grew by 31% yoy; with ACV of $50,000 or more grew by 58% yoy, and with ACV of $100,000 or more grew by 68%. This indicates that Smartsheet can rely on increasingly lucrative recurring revenues going forward. JPM’s 5-star analyst Mark Murphy is impressed with Smartsheet's recent performance, enough to upgrade his stance on the stock from Neutral to Overweight (i.e. Buy). “We have been articulating a thesis that this category of collaborative work management wasn’t an immediate pandemic-response type of purchase, but we had theorized that it could start to gain attention later in the cycle as companies have more time to think about ways to get work done outside of Zoom and as they get more visibility into the distribution of their workforces post-COVID-19…. We continue to believe that Smartsheet faces ample growth opportunities across several vectors and thus carries potential to become part of the enterprise software fabric within organizations,” Murphy commented. Murphy puts an $83 price target on the stock to back his Buy rating, implying an upside of 32% for the next 12 months. (To watch Murphy’s track record, click here) All in all, a total of 8 analysts have weighed in on Smartsheet shares, and their recommendations include 7 Buys against just 1 Hold. This gives the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. SMAR is selling for $62.86 right now, and its $82 average price target suggest a runway to 30% upside this year.

Analyst Says ‘Buy’","link":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-cannabis-stocks-benefit-york-204529046.html","summary":"Sometimes, popular sentiment fuels a market boom, and nowhere is that more evident than in the legal marijuana industry. However, cannabis remains illegal in the US at the Federal level, rendering the various state-level legalization regimes a patchwork of disconnected policies. Still, there is hope that the current Congress may pursue a Federal legalization bill – but before that happens, investors are watching to see which state or states will enact full legalization next. And high on that list is New York. BTIG analyst Camilo Lyon has been following the marijuana legalization movement in New York, and sees positive developments down the road. \"Currently, we are modeling adult use sales in NY to begin in 4Q22, however, given the pace and focus cannabis reform is being given by the state legislature, we could see our timeline for legal adult use sales advance to 1Q22. We estimate this would increase our NY market revenue assumption to $749M from $187M, an increase of $562M. More importantly, we estimate 2023 sales would grow to $3.8B in recreational sales, that is $2.8B greater than what our current timeline would suggest,\" Lyon opined. To this end, Lyon has picked out two cannabis stocks that have already built a presence in New York State, and could surge over 60% in the year ahead. After running both tickers through TipRanks’ database, we found out that the rest of the Street is also on board, as each sports a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Curaleaf (CURLF) We’ll start by going big, and looking at Curaleaf. This company’s $10.9 billion market cap and $670 million annual revenues make it the world’s largest cannabis company. Curaleaf has a wide reach, with headquarters in Massachusetts and operations in 23 states. These operations include 23 cultivation facilities, 30 processing facilities, 101 dispensaries, and over 1,800 wholesale dispensary accounts. Even though the US cannabis market is fragmented, Curaleaf showed steadily rising revenues and year-over-year gains in each quarter of 2020. Starting with $104 million in Q1, the company reached $240.4 million in top-line revenues by Q4, a 
201% year-over-year (yoy) gain. This was driven by a 242% yoy gain in quarterly retail revenue, which reached $164.9 million, and a whopping 578% yoy gain in wholesale revenue, which came in at $64.4 million. New York State makes up a small part of Curaleaf’s total business. Per the state’s current regulation, Curaleaf has the maximum of 1 cultivation/processing facility in New York, along with 4 dispensary licenses, all operating for the medical cannabis market. Still, this gives Curaleaf an established footprint from which to expand should the state legalize for recreational use. In his coverage of this stock, BTIG’s Lyon writes, “We believe CURA’s diverse geographic footprint will be the key growth 
driver supporting annual sales growth of 87% for the next two years…. Importantly, we estimate CURA turned free cash flow positive last year and will continue to generate sufficient FCF over the next two years to fund investments in its 
broad 23 state footprint.” To this end, Lyon rates Curaleaf a Buy rating, and his price target, at C$35 (US$28) suggests an upside of 75% for the coming year. (To watch Lyon’s track record, click here) Wall Street seems to agree with Lyon’s bullish call on this stock, as shown by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buy reviews. The stock is selling for US$15.99 and its US$22.26 average price target suggests it has room for 39% growth by year’s end. (See Curaleaf stock analysis on TipRanks) Green Thumb (GTBIF) Next up is Green Thumb, a Chicago-based medical and consumer marijuana company with a network of facilities across 12 US states. These facilities include 13 manufacturing operations and 97 retail locations. The company’s retail products include edibles, vapes, and pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes, as well as CBD wellness items for the home health market. Like Curaleaf above, Green Thumb has a footprint in New York, within that state’s regulatory limits. The activities include three dispensary licenses, but no cultivation facility. The company, however, has already experienced transitioning a medical-use-only operation to a recreational model in the state of Illinois, and so has an organizational template should New York make a similar legal change. Green Thumb has released Q4 numbers on Wednesday, delivering better than expected topline growth. Specifically, revenue grew 13% QoQ 
to $177.2 million, beating consensus estimate of $166.7 million. EBITDA was also better than expected, growing 23% to $65.4 million, compared to the Street's estimates of $58.3 million. Camilo Lyon covers Green Thumb, and writes of the company and its New York prospects: “Local news reported in January that [Green Thumb] may be planning to build a distribution facility in Warwick, NY (~50 miles north of Manhattan). According to reports, the distribution facility would include three buildings, two at 100,000 square feet and one at 200,000 square feet at the Warwick Technology Park. This news is particularly important as we believe NY could legalize adult-use as early as this year, and [Green Thumb] investing in new distribution capacity ahead of legalization should give it an edge to meet what should be overwhelming demand by recreational customers.” To this end, the analyst puts a Buy rating on this stock, and his C$73 (US$58 price target suggests a 69% one-year upside potential. (To watch Lyon’s track record, click here) All in all, Green Thumb has 8 Buy reviews, adding up to unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $34.49, and its $47 average price target implies a 36% 12-month upside from that level.

processing facilities, 101 dispensaries, and over 1,800 wholesale dispensary accounts.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Even though the US cannabis market is fragmented, Curaleaf showed steadily rising revenues and year-over-year gains in each quarter of 2020. Starting with $104 million in Q1, the company reached $240.4 million in top-line revenues by Q4, a 201% year-over-year (yoy) gain. This was driven by a 242% yoy gain in quarterly retail revenue, which reached $164.9 million, and a whopping 578% yoy gain in wholesale revenue, which came in at $64.4 million.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>New York State makes up a small part of Curaleaf’s total business. Per the state’s current regulation, Curaleaf has the maximum of 1 cultivation/processing facility in New York, along with 4 dispensary licenses, all operating for the medical cannabis market. Still, this gives Curaleaf an established footprint from which to expand should the state legalize for recreational use.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>In his coverage of this stock, BTIG’s Lyon writes, “We believe CURA’s diverse geographic footprint will be the key growth driver supporting annual sales growth of 87% for the next two years…. Importantly, we estimate CURA turned free cash flow positive last year and will continue to generate sufficient FCF over the next two years 
to fund investments in its broad 23 state footprint.”</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>To this end, Lyon rates Curaleaf a Buy rating, and his price target, at C$35 (US$28) suggests an upside of 75% for the coming year. (To watch Lyon’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/camilo-lyon\"><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Wall Street seems to agree with Lyon’s bullish call on this stock, as shown by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buy reviews. The stock is selling for US$15.99 and its US$22.26 average price target suggests it has room for 39% growth by year’s end.

These facilities include 13 manufacturing operations and 97 retail locations. The company’s retail products include edibles, vapes, and pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes, as well as CBD wellness items for the home health market. </p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Like Curaleaf above, Green Thumb has a footprint in New York, within that state’s regulatory limits. The activities include three dispensary licenses, but no cultivation facility. The company, however, has already experienced transitioning a medical-use-only operation to a recreational model in the state of Illinois, and so has an organizational template should New York make a similar legal change.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Green Thumb has released Q4 numbers on Wednesday, delivering better than expected topline growth. Specifically, revenue grew 13% QoQ to $177.2 million, beating consensus estimate of $166.7 million. EBITDA was also better than expected, growing 23% to $65.4 million, compared 
to the Street's estimates of $58.3 million.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Camilo Lyon covers Green Thumb, and writes of the company and its New York prospects: “Local news reported in January that [Green Thumb] may be planning to build a distribution facility in Warwick, NY (~50 miles north of Manhattan). According to reports, the distribution facility would include three buildings, two at 100,000 square feet and one at 200,000 square feet at the Warwick Technology Park. This news is particularly important as we believe NY could legalize adult-use as early as this year, and [Green Thumb] investing in new distribution capacity ahead of legalization should give it an edge to meet what should be overwhelming demand by recreational customers.”</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>To this end, the analyst puts a Buy rating on this stock, and his C$73 (US$58 price target suggests a 69% one-year upside potential. (To watch Lyon’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/camilo-lyon\"><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>All in all, Green Thumb has 8 Buy reviews, adding up to unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $34.49, and its $47 average price target implies a 36% 12-month upside from that level.

Tensions in the Middle East have climbed this month. Warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition dropped bombs on Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa earlier this month following attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil and military facilities that have been blamed on Iran-backed Houthi rebels.

While prices are starting to even back out, they’re still significantly lower than they once were, according to Apartment List, a real estate data site.</p> \n<p>As a renter, you can use this to your advantage. Working from home is sure to be the norm for a while longer, and people are flocking to mid-size markets and smaller towns for more space.</p> \n<p>If you want to keep renting in the city, now’s the time to lock in a lease at a great price — you may even be able to negotiate with your current landlord for an

And it's never been easier to put money into the market: <a href=\"https://moneywise.com/a/stash-vs-acorns-vs-robinhood-which-is-the-best-investing-app?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=16053&amp;utm_content=16053_All+you+need+is+a+smartphone+app\">All you need is a smartphone app</a>.</p> \n<p>And don’t forget that owning a home also involves a number of non-recoupable costs like mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance, interest and property taxes. And when something breaks down, you’ve got to fix it yourself instead of simply calling the landlord.</p> \n<p>All that that adds up and you’ll never see a return on those investments.</p> \n<h3>There’s more to life</h3> \n<p>Finally, the premise that owning is better than renting also assumes that homeownership is your No. 1 priority, without taking into account other goals you may have to spend your money on or what you’d like to do with your life.</p> \n<p>If you don’t picture yourself repainting the ol’ white picket fence every spring, there are plenty of other enriching things you can do with your cash.</p> \n<h2>Other ways to enrich your life</h2> \n<p></p>\n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Man holding a stack of cash, fanned out\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OrsEDGq_GOVQeH2Ym51zvA--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/5dcdda6d3a792fcde9803718c85dbeec\"> \n <figcaption>\n  <cite>Brian A Jackson / Shutterstock</cite>\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p></p> \n<p>When you’re paying a reasonable amount in rent, it frees up all kinds of money for other pursuits that can be just as financially worthwhile as owning your own home.</p> \n<p>Here are a few.</p> \n<h3>1. Invest</h3> \n<p>Investing in stocks, bonds and ETF, either through a certified financial planner or a <a href=\"https://moneywise.com/a/stash-vs-acorns-vs-robinhood-which-is-the-best-investing-app?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=16053&amp;utm_content=16053_low-commission+investing+app\">low-commission investing app</a> is a great way to grow your money.</p> \n<p>You don’t even need thousands of dollars to play the market — some apps will <a href=\"https://moneywise.com/a/how-your-small-change-can-help-build-your-investing-portfolio?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=16053&amp;utm_content=16053_automatially+invest+your+spare+change\">automatially invest your spare change</a> on debit and credit card purchases.</p> \n<h3>2. Save</h3> \n<p></p>\n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Female hand putting money into piggy bank and counting on calculator closeup\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LfmxBv1r8DZ0RtTmTbi1Zw--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/c275b16ba1cdcadfcac7970878155991\"> \n <figcaption>\n  <cite>Africa Studio / Shutterstock</cite>\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p></p> \n<p>If you want to grow your money and you already invest or you’re risk-averse, you should consider a high-yield savings account. This type of account can pay upwards of 200 more times than your standard savings account.</p> \n<p>Whatever you want to put your money aside for, whether that be an emergency, vacation savings or for a big purchase, a high-yield savings account can be the perfect place to keep your cash safe <em>and</em> working for you.</p> \n<h3>3. Pay off debt</h3> \n<p>Credit is convenient, but interest is a killer. If you’ve been relying on your plastic through the 
pandemic, you’re probably piling up plenty of expensive interest by now.</p> \n<p>It may be time to consider putting housing-cost savings towards <a href=\"https://moneywise.com/a/take-a-break-from-your-debt-this-month?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=16053&amp;utm_content=16053_consolidating+your+debt\">consolidating your debt</a>. By dropping all your balances into a single lower-interest loan, you can make your debt easier to manage and even 
pay it off sooner.</p> \n<p>If consolidating all of your debt isn’t an option, make sure to focus on your highest interest loans first. And don’t be shy to make extra payments when you can afford it.</p> \n<h3>4. Shop around for deals</h3> \n<p></p>\n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Young couple use credit card for online shopping on laptop\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lXltLiyx7j76SJRfLofs7g--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/bce9317b92876f904601a7efaba7e90b\"> \n <figcaption>\n  <cite>Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock</cite>\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, living modestly doesn't have to feel like a punishment. In fact, the more excess expenses you cut out, the more money you'll be able to put towards what you really care about. Your standard of living will be higher overall.</p> \n<p>So if you like to shop online, you can download <a href=\"https://moneywise.com/a/shopping-online-find-better-deals?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=16053&amp;utm_content=16053_a+free+browser+extension\">a free browser extension</a> that will instantly find you the best deals and coupons.</p> \n<h3>5. Invest in yourself</h3> \n<p>It's never a bad idea to upgrade your marketable skills by going back to school. Even if you haven’t got all the funds upfront for a college program, taking out a student loan at a competitive rate can help make your dream come true without costing you all your savings.</p> \n<h2>“But owning a home is my dream”</h2> \n<p></p>\n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Couple With Keys Standing Outside New Home\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8Afl0tbPvOTM5_ExHYh6Tg--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/8cd37ba32b826bdd11eddb2046283b4d\"> \n <figcaption>\n  <cite>Monkey Business Images / Shutterstock</cite>\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p></p> \n<p>If your heart is set on becoming a homeowner, you’re not necessarily destined to become house-poor.</p> \n<p>Just make sure you follow these tips to make sure you come out of it in the best financial position:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>

An interest rate just 0.5% lower can save you tens of thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.</li> \n <li> <strong>Save on homeowners insurance.</strong> Homeowners insurance is a must, but overpaying is not.

2,460% Roller Coaster Rumbles to Reality Check","link":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-2-460-roller-coaster-131733513.html","summary":"(Bloomberg) -- In the wild, speculative ride known as GameStop Corp., traders are about to get a real-world dose of data when the video-game retailer reports earnings next week. Whether the results justify the company’s $14 billion 
market value is another issue entirely.While shares of the Grapevine, Texas-based company have given back a huge chunk of this year’s 2,460% gain after hitting a record intraday high of $483 in late January, they’re still up better than 
900%, closing Thursday at $201.75.

environment.</strong></p>\n<p>In 
2020, for obvious reasons, there was a lot of attention on the pharmaceutical industry. While a few stocks like Moderna (ticker: <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/mrna-moderna-inc\">MRNA</a>) and Pfizer (<a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/pfe-pfizer-inc\">PFE</a>) have jumped thanks to their <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/pharmaceutical-companies-racing-for-a-vaccine\">COVID-19 vaccines</a>, long-term investors should be more interested in the large and stable drugmakers that throw off reliable income year after year. After all, a pandemic of this scale won't happen every year, but chronic conditions like high blood pressure 
and diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's have created big demand for new drugs. For massive companies that make up the global prescription drug industry, there is a measure of stability in any economic environment as patients pass up discretionary expense first and their medication last. That adds up to steady profits that fuel steady dividends, as evidenced by these nine leading pharma stocks.</p>\n<p><strong>AbbVie (<a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/abbv-abbvie-inc\">ABBV</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>AbbVie is as reliable as income investments come, with a track record of 49 consecutive years of dividend increases. It's also paying out a generous yield right now that is more than three times that of the S&amp;P 500. There's a bit of product pipeline risk, as AbbVie's top-selling drug Humira will lose patent protection in 2023 in the U.S. The drugmaker has already forecast a modest decline in future revenue as a result. However, it's also forecasting a return to growth in 2024. That forecast, alongside a strong history of <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/dividend-stocks-to-buy-with-growing-payouts\">higher dividends</a>, shows this is a pharmaceutical stock investors can depend on for the long haul.</p>\n<p><strong>Current yield:</strong> 4.95%</p>\n<p><strong>Amgen (<a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amgn-amgen-inc\">AMGN</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>While Amgen hasn't been in the headlines lately like some Big Pharma stocks with COVID-19 vaccines, it has been making plenty of news of a different kind. In March, the company acquired cancer-focused <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/the-best-biotech-stocks-to-buy-today\">biotechnology</a> company Five Prime Therapeutics for $1.9 billion to boost its oncology pipeline. That comes after a deal in 2019 to purchase a 
$2.7 billion stake in Chinese cancer biotech BeiGene, too. This has positioned AMGN as one of the preeminent cancer-fighting pharmaceutical companies on the planet, an area that will remain in high demand for years to come. Shares have been choppy in the last year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, but these deals hint that the future is bright for this drugmaker.</p>\n<p><strong>Current yield:</strong> 2.88%</p>\n<p><strong>AstraZeneca (<a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/azn-astrazeneca-plc-adr\">AZN</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>AstraZeneca stock got a bit of bad news in 2021 as some European countries expressed concerns over its coronavirus vaccine and potential blood clots link -- but the European Medicines Agency has said the benefits of the company's vaccine outweigh the risks. What's more, the long-term picture remains very bright thanks to its plan announced in December 2020 to acquire Alexion Pharmaceuticals in a $39 
billion deal. The way of the world in Big Pharma is either get bigger or get squeezed by your competitors, and AZN is clearly committed to ensuring it has the scale and deep drug portfolio necessary to compete well beyond 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Current yield:</strong> 2.89%</p>\n<p><strong>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (<a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/bmy-bristol-myers-squibb-co\">BMY</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>Keeping with the theme of big-time acquisitions in Big Pharma, more than a year ago, BMY closed a massive $74 billion acquisition with high-growth biotech firm Celgene. A deal that size would have come with plenty of complications even in a normal environment, but integrating operations amid the pandemic made it an even more complex task. Yet now that the dust has settled, Bristol-Myers looks to be seeing significant top-line and bottom-line benefits. That's on top of an already robust pipeline of drugs that includes blood thinner Eliquis, which saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, year over year, to tally more than $2 billion in sales. The $140 billion drugmaker has the scale and depth necessary to thrive over the long term, so investors can have confidence that shares will hang tough and dividends will keep rolling for many years to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Current yield:</strong> 3.17%</p>\n<p><strong>Gilead Sciences (<a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/gild-gilead-sciences-inc\">GILD</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>Not all tie-ups in pharma have to come with all those zeroes attached.
